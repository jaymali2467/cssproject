## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Js

### What I learned

```css proud of using variables to make it easier to edit the css
:root {
  --soft-orange: hsl(35, 77%, 62%);
  --soft-red: hsl(5, 85%, 63%);
  --off-white: hsl(36, 100%, 99%);
  --grayish-blue: hsl(233, 8%, 79%);
  --dark-grayish-blue: hsl(236, 13%, 42%);
  --very-dark-blue: hsl(240, 100%, 5%);
}
```

```js
function openMenu() {
  navMobile.classList.add("active");
  body.style.overflow = "hidden";
  menuToggle.setAttribute("aria-expanded", "true");
}
```

### Continued development

- Learn using flex and grid more efficently
- Learn using react and express
